# FHIRworks Framework (FWF)
This project provides a clinical application framework built on the [CareWeb Framework](http://www.carewebframework.org) and based on an abstraction of common clinical domain objects derived from the FHIR specification.  Plugin components that leverage this abstraction can be constructed so as to be EMR-agnostic.  

Included in the project are patient selection and patient list management components that leverage the FWF.  A few sample UI plugins are also provided.
